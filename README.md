# Spreedly Airlines

This is the frontend only version of the Spreedly Airlines Sample App to familiarize myself with the Spreedly API 

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo:

```
$ open .../front_end_spreedly_airlines/index.html
```

## Notes
* I couldn't figure out how to get the JS file to reload after each event in Rails, so I decided to just run everything in HTML and JS only
